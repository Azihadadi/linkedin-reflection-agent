# Reflection Agent with LangGraph

Build a **self-improving AI system** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) — a powerful framework for graph-based AI workflows.  
In this guided project, we create a **Reflection Agent** that can **generate content, evaluate its own outputs, identify weaknesses, and iteratively refine results** through feedback loops.  

---

## Project Overview
Reflection agents represent a significant advancement in AI capabilities.  
They enable models to:
- **Think critically** about their own outputs  
- **Evaluate quality** against defined criteria  
- **Refine content iteratively** until the result is polished  

In this project, the example use case is a **LinkedIn Post Generator**:  
Starting from a basic draft, the agent improves clarity, tone, and engagement — mimicking **human-like reflective thinking**.
