# Reflection Agent with LangGraph

Build a **self-improving AI system** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) â€” a powerful framework for graph-based AI workflows.  
In this guided project, we create a **Reflection Agent** that can **generate content, evaluate its own outputs, identify weaknesses, and iteratively refine results** through feedback loops.  

---

## Project Overview
Reflection agents represent a significant advancement in AI capabilities.  
They enable models to:
- **Think critically** about their own outputs  
- **Evaluate quality** against defined criteria  
- **Refine content iteratively** until the result is polished  

In this project, the example use case is a **LinkedIn Post Generator**:  
Starting from a basic draft, the agent improves clarity, tone, and engagement â€” mimicking **human-like reflective thinking**.

## Features
- Graph-based workflow powered by **LangGraph**  
- Self-evaluation & feedback loop  
- Generates and refines LinkedIn posts  
- Demonstrates **reflection in AI** step by step

## Repository Structure
```
reflection-agent-langgraph/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Reflection_Agent.ipynb # Main notebook with full workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt # Dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md #
```

---

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reflection-agent-langgraph.git
cd reflection-agent-langgraph
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook Reflection_Agent.ipynb
```
Follow the steps inside to:

- Generate a draft LinkedIn post

- Let the Reflection Agent evaluate and critique it

- See the improved, polished version

## Example Output

Input (draft):
```
I want to share my new project about AI agents.
```
Refined Output (after reflection):
```
Excited to share my latest project on AI Reflection Agents! ðŸš€  
These agents can evaluate their own work, improve iteratively, and produce high-quality results.  
Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
```
## Workflow
Below is a simplified diagram of the reflection loop:
