# Reflection Agent with LangGraph

This project implements a **Reflection Agent** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), designed to demonstrate how AI systems can **evaluate and improve their own outputs** through iterative feedback loops.  

The agent follows a graph-based workflow that mimics **human-like reflective thinking**:  
- It generates initial content (e.g., LinkedIn posts)  
- Critically evaluates the quality of its outputs  
- Identifies weaknesses and areas for improvement  
- Refines results across multiple iterations  

The result is a self-improving AI system capable of producing **clear, polished, and engaging content** with minimal human intervention.

## Project Overview
Reflection agents represent a significant advancement in AI capabilities.  
They enable models to:
- **Think critically** about their own outputs  
- **Evaluate quality** against defined criteria  
- **Refine content iteratively** until the result is polished  

In this project, the example use case is a **LinkedIn Post Generator**:  
Starting from a basic draft, the agent improves clarity, tone, and engagement â€” mimicking **human-like reflective thinking**.

## Features
- Graph-based workflow powered by **LangGraph**  
- Self-evaluation & feedback loop  
- Generates and refines LinkedIn posts  
- Demonstrates **reflection in AI** step by step

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reflection-agent-langgraph.git
cd reflection-agent-langgraph
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook Reflection_Agent.ipynb
```
Follow the steps inside to:

- Generate a draft LinkedIn post

- Let the Reflection Agent evaluate and critique it

- See the improved, polished version

## Example Output

Input (draft):
```
I want to share my new project about AI agents.
```
Refined Output (after reflection):
```
Excited to share my latest project on AI Reflection Agents! ðŸš€  
These agents can evaluate their own work, improve iteratively, and produce high-quality results.  
Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
```
## Workflow
The agent follows a graph-based workflow that enables iterative self-improvement:
